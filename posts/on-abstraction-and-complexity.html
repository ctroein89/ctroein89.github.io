			<h1>
				Abstractions Don't Remove Complexity
			</h1>
			<p>
				Abstraction is taking logic, and bundling it in such a way that you have
				a simpler inferface. Complexity is the number of internal interactions
				that need to happen to make the program work. Abstraction merely hides
				complexity, but it doesn't reduce complexity (any may actually increase 
				it <a href="#footer1">[1]</a>).
			</p>
			<p>
				The more that I code, the less that I believe that abstraction can
				remove or reduce complexity. Some times, a good abstraction still
				increases complexity. Abstraction can be more ergonomic to call, but the
				complexity will always there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some differentiate between essential and accidental complexity:
				essential complexity is required by the problem being solved, and
				accidental is based on the organization. If you remove as much
				accidental complexity as possible, what's left is going to be essential
				complexity. And for abstractions, that's somewhat true. But I also posit
				that the abstraction itself is a friction, that itself has a cost
				through existing.
			</p>

			<h2>
				All Things Being Equal, Ownership Is Simpler than Abstraction
			</h2>
			<p>
				A system should take ownership of its complexity, and lift complexity
				up. A system should favor direct, lower-level implementations where
				possible, and put configuration of that code directly in the
				configuration of the service. Be explicit.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a system needs to interact with Kafka, the Kafka library should be
				exposed at the top level. Network requests and routing will
				eventually become the calling code's problem, even if to just do
				something as basic as running code on an ARM64 machine. In theory,
				updating Kafka should be as simple as updating a dependency, and then
				rebuilding. But if the platform controls the Kafka dependency, then
				you can only update the platform, and you have to rely on the platform's
				specific documentation for how to manage Kafka.
			</p>
			<p>
				Take on dependencies to solve problems, instead of selecting platforms
				to avoid direct responsibility of problems. A managed Kafka, Redis or
				OpenSearch cluster running in the cloud means that you don't have to
				deal with the cluster on a day-to-day basis, but you still own the
				health of system, whether or not your cloud provider is managing it (
				and you always have the option of replacing your cloud provider).
			</p>

			<h2>
				To Wit: PySpark Is Bad
			</h2>
			<p>
				This all leading up to a particular take: PySpark is overly complex for
				what it does. In theory, it's supposed to make scaling and batching
				"not my problem", but I've broken PySpark jobs because I didn't really
				think about how system limitations would impact me. If I have to worry
				about memory limitations and networking and scaling for a system that's
				supposed to handle that for me, I'd rather directly handle the
				cross-process/cross-machine communication myself, directly via
				dependencies that I control. I want my code to show it's sharp-edges to
				me.

					As soon as an abstraction needs to retain state, it starts leaking its
					complexity into it's callers.
					<br>
					iOS UI libraries end up suffering because UIKit components are
					stateful, but is also the way to render native UI elements. One can
					create replacement buttons, but they won't look like the UIKit buttons
					that iOS users expect. Trying to wrap UIKit with alternative
					abstractions performs poorly, because UIKit is optimized around
					UIKit's lifecycle that's tied to UIKit's abstractions. In other words,
					it's impossible to re-abstract UIKit with a different abstraction:
					the result will necessarily be less performant, and harder to work
					with, than just using UIKit directly.
